I am a **second-year PhD student** in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.albany.edu/ece) at the [University at Albany (SUNY)](https://www.albany.edu), advised by [Dr. Daphney-Stavrourla Zois](https://www.albany.edu/ece/faculty/daphney-stavroula-zois), and a member of [IMAgINELab](https://imagine9lab.github.io/index.html). I also serve as a **Teaching Assistant** in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering within the [College of Nanotechnology, Science, and Engineering (CNSE)](https://www.albany.edu/cnse) at UAlbany.

I received my **B.Sc.** in [Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/) from the [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/), where I majored in **Communication and Signal Processing**. My undergraduate thesis was completed under the supervision of [Dr. Hafiz Imtiaz](https://hafizimtiaz.buet.ac.bd/) and [Dr. Tahsina Farah Sanam](https://sites.google.com/site/tahsinafarahsanam/).

Before joining UAlbany, I worked as an **Adjunct Lecturer** in the [Department of Textile Machinery Design and Maintenance (TMDM)](https://www.butex.edu.bd/department-of-textile-machinery-design-and-maintenance/) at the [Bangladesh University of Textiles (BUTEX)](https://www.butex.edu.bd) and as a **Part-time Lecturer** in the [Department of EEE](https://pu.edu.bd/eee/) at [Presidency University](https://pu.edu.bd/), Dhaka. 

My research interests focus on **adaptive, cost-aware, and interpretable machine learning**, with the goal of enabling reliable decision-making in **dynamic and high-stakes environments**.

## Joy Saha

I am a second-year PhD student in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering** at the **University at Albany (SUNY)**, advised by **Dr. Daphney Stavoural Zois**. My research focuses on designing learning and decision-making systems that operate efficiently under resource constraints, with particular emphasis on balancing cost and performance in real-world settings.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the **Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)**, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Alongside my doctoral studies, I serve as a **Teaching Assistant** in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering** and the **College of Nanotechnology, Science, and Engineering (CNSE)** at the University at Albany.

Prior to joining UAlbany, I worked as an **Adjunct Lecturer** in the **Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering** at **Presidency University**, Dhaka, and in the **Department of Textile Machinery Design and Maintenance (TMDM)** at the **Bangladesh University of Textiles (BUTEX)**.

My broader goal is to build **adaptive, cost-aware, and interpretable machine learning systems** that can support reliable decision-making in dynamic and high-stakes environments.

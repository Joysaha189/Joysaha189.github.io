## Joy Saha

I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.albany.edu/ece) at the
[University at Albany (SUNY)](https://www.albany.edu),
advised by [Dr. Daphney-Stavrourla Zois](https://www.albany.edu/ece/faculty/daphney-stavroula-zois).
I completed my undergraduate studies at the **Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)**, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Alongside my doctoral studies, I serve as a **Teaching Assistant** in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering** and the [College of Nanotechnology, Science, and Engineering (CNSE)](https://www.albany.edu/cnse) at the University at Albany.

Prior to joining UAlbany, I worked as an **Adjunct Lecturer** in the **Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering** at **Presidency University**, Dhaka, and in the **Department of Textile Machinery Design and Maintenance (TMDM)** at the **Bangladesh University of Textiles (BUTEX)**.

My broader goal is to build **adaptive, cost-aware, and interpretable machine learning systems** that can support reliable decision-making in dynamic and high-stakes environments.

I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.albany.edu/ece) at the
[University at Albany (SUNY)](https://www.albany.edu),
advised by [Dr. Daphney-Stavrourla Zois](https://www.albany.edu/ece/faculty/daphney-stavroula-zois) of [IMaGINELab](https://imagine9lab.github.io/index.html)
I completed my undergraduate studies at the [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/), Dhaka, Bangladesh in the [Department of EEE](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/) . Alongside my doctoral studies, I serve as a **Teaching Assistant** in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering** of the [College of Nanotechnology, Science, and Engineering (CNSE)](https://www.albany.edu/cnse) at the University at Albany.

Prior to joining UAlbany, I worked as an **Adjunct Lecturer** in the [Department of EEE](https://pu.edu.bd/eee/) at [Presidency University](https://pu.edu.bd/), Dhaka, and in the [Department of Textile Machinery Design and Maintenance (TMDM)](https://www.butex.edu.bd/department-of-textile-machinery-design-and-maintenance/) at the [Bangladesh University of Textiles (BUTEX)](https://www.butex.edu.bd).

My broader goal is to build **adaptive, cost-aware, and interpretable machine learning systems** that can support reliable decision-making in dynamic and high-stakes environments.
